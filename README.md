# LetsGetCheckedAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.

NOTE: json-server has been moved into this repo and it will be launched in parallel with the client application.

PORT NUMBER HAS BEEN CHANGED to 9003 because i have other applications using the same port on my computer that are in use for work and I don't want to shut down.


# Get Started
- make sure you have node installed
- clone repo to your computer
- open a terminal window from the cloned project
- run "npm install" to install the application
- run "npm start" ( this should start the api server on port 9003 instead of 9001, and as well launch your browser at localhost:9003 )
- run "ng test" to launch unit tests
